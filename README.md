# Weather-Station-Arduino
Weather Station with Arduino using Wemos D1 R1

# Equipment:
- DHT11 (temperature and humidity) Sensor (You can use DHT22 as well)
- Micro SD module (we use Micro-SD/TF) 
- Wemos D1 R1 (Old board, Microprocessor: ESP8266EX, Compatible with Arduino)
- SIM900 GSM/GPRS (Quad-Band)

P.S. : You can use Wemos D1 R2 instead R1 but it is a little different in pins, if have any problems just ask [Google](https://www.Google.com/)
